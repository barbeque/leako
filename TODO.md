- [x] figure out if i can use the LC331632M-12 (32k words * 16 bits) sram left over from the x'eye project - should work
- [ ] figure out what the _other_ RAM was from the x'eye project - was it DRAM?
- [x] set up the SRAM-adapter for the TMS-9918 from the PDF - it's simple
- [x] figure out if I can use any of the ROMs i already have - yes, a 27c256 is more than enough
- [ ] how does the original decode logic work with so few chips?
- [x] can i use one sanyo 16-bit ram for both the vdp and z80 since it has individual byte enables? NO
- [ ] check the footprint against a real TMS9918 (print it out sooner rather than later)
- [x] can I use a knockoff U2413 as an AY-3-8910 to save some board room? are they that deeply compatible? i guess i already own an AY-3-8910. NEVER MIND IT'S AN SN76489 - already on order
- [x] video amp? used the one from the PDF
- [ ] audio amp?
- [ ] reset circuit
- [ ] cpu clock circuit
- [x] how is the TMS clocked?
- [x] do i need to reverse a7..a0 for the TMS, or is that for data, or not at all?
- [ ] what does RD in the schematic do? they wouldn't have an extra inverter stage for nothing.
- [x] figure out memory decode
- [x] figure out IO decode
- [x] figure out cart decode (a subset of memory decode - bank switching)
- [ ] what even are controllers?
- [x] add a bios rom
- [ ] put in the keep-out zone for the cartridge slot (81mm x 40mm)
- [x] ram wraparound?
- [x] BIOS: what is up with the separate CE and OE in the original schematic (CE from A11?) Figure it out!!!
- [x] Expansion stubs (EXT_DEC_STUB, EXT_IO_STUB) need pullups or they'll fuck up
- [ ] what is up with the -5V on the controller schematic?
