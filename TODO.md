- [ ] figure out if i can use the LC331632M-12 (32k words * 16 bits) sram left over from the x'eye project
- [ ] figure out what the _other_ RAM was from the x'eye project
- [ ] figure out if I can use any of the ROMs i already have
- [ ] how does the original decode logic work with so few chips?
- [ ] can i use one sanyo 16-bit ram for both the vdp and z80 since it has individual byte enables?
- [ ] check the footprint against a real TMS9918 (print it out sooner rather than later)
