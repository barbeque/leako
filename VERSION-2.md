- [ ] ESD protection diodes on the controller ports
- [x] use fewer inverters (do we need any 04s or can they all be an 05?)
- [ ] jumper for BIOS ROM selection (e.g. no-delay)
- [ ] (not needed) better footprint for cart connector, with screw holes
- [x] use a through-hole electrolytic for the 68uF clock circuit
- [x] reverse data bus on 76489 (Z80 D7 -> 76489 D0)
- [x] use a 1206 bipolar ceramic for the 68uF clock circuit
- [x] figure out what the !Q -> D problem with "U8" is and how clock is supposed to look
- [x] ok redo the entire clock circuit from the other schematic. there is a lot of fuckup. 68uF vs. 68pF
- [ ] do i really need the -5V inverter or can i just hook it to GND with better logic?
