- [ ] ESD protection diodes on the controller ports
- [ ] use fewer inverters (do we need any 04s or can they all be an 05?)
- [ ] jumper for BIOS ROM selection (e.g. no-delay)
- [ ] better footprint for cart connector, with screw holes
- [x] use a through-hole electrolytic for the 68uF clock circuit
